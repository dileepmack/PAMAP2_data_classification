The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset containing data on 9 individuals engaging in various physical activities. The dataset is provided in the form of DAT files and includes information from a heart rate monitor and three IMU sensors attached to the hand, chest, and ankle.

Before we could begin our analysis, it was necessary to merge the data for all 9 subjects into a single dataframe to enable efficient processing. The ultimate goal of this assignment is to use the results of our analysis to gain insights on an individual's level of physical activity based on the activities they engage in. To achieve this, we will conduct various methods and algrithms learned in our module.

Requirements to be carried:

Carry out thorough exploratory data analysis and appropriately handle missing or dirty data;
Develop and test at least one hypothesis for a relationship between a single pair of attributes;
Develop and test at least one model which uses multiple attributes to make predictions.
